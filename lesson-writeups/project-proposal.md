# What will you do?

I want to learn about the polyhedral model for loop optimization, and implement a simple form of this model for the Bril compiler ecosystem. I am hoping to see an improvement in the number of dynamic instructions executed. I am not planning to generate code targeting a specific architecture, and am not planning to evaluate on an actual processor.

I will read over lecture nodes/slides relating to the polyhedral model. I need to catch up on aspects of linear programming and integer programming. 

These notes seem promising:
https://polyhedral.info/ - from an older version of CS 6120
https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/achauhan/Teaching/B629/2010-Fall/StudentPresns/PolyhedralModelOverview.pdf
https://events.csa.iisc.ac.in/summerschool2013/slides/automatic-parallelization-introduction-polyhedral-models.pdf

# How will you do it?



# How will you empirically measure success?

I will either create my own benchmarks or translate some benchmarks into bril, relating to the polyhedral model.
